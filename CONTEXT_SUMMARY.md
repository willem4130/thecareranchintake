2. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed 14-day build plan with every step
3. **DESIGN_SYSTEM.md** - Complete design specifications (colors, fonts, components)
4. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - What's completed, what's next, database info
5. **README.md** - Technical setup and dependencies (already existed)

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation** âœ… COMPLETE

- Database schema created (10+ models)
