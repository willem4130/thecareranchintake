Intake Form The Care Ranch Leadership Retreat 



Thank you for your commitment to join us for a 5-day immersive journey in Tubac, Arizona. 

This intake form helps us understand how you think about yourself, how you approach challenges and opportunities, and which areas of your personal leadership you most want to strengthen—whether through our herd-wisdom equine sessions, kinesiology muscle-biofeedback, or one-on-one integrative coaching.

You’ll find questions about your mindset, your personal and professional aspirations, and a few health-related items needed to ensure your safety and optimize your experience with Elemental Body Alignment System (EBAS) and Kinesiology/LEAP Life Enhancement Acupressure Protocols. There are no right or wrong answers —only insights that guide us in co-creating a retreat program tailored to your personal needs.

Anything that isn’t clear or needs further explanation will be discussed during the intake interview at the start of the retreat. None of your answers will be shared in a group setting. If a question doesn’t feel relevant or you prefer not to answer, feel free to skip it. Please submit your completed form at least one week before the retreat start date so we can prepare your personalized roadmap.

We handle all your data with the strictest confidentiality. All responses are strictly confidential and used only to tailor your retreat journey.
